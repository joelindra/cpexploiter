## CPExploiter

CPExploiter is a command-line tool designed for vulnerability checking and subdomain enumeration. It leverages common security tools to identify potential vulnerabilities and validate subdomains for a given domain.

Features:

- Vulnerability Checking: Scans IP addresses for known vulnerabilities based on response content.
- Subdomain Enumeration: Finds subdomains for a given domain using subfinder and validates them with httprobe.
- Automatic Saving: Saves details of vulnerabilities to a specified folder in a structured format.
- Flexible Input: Supports single targets, file-based targets, and domain-based autoscan.

Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- subfinder
- httprobe
- curl

Installation:

1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpexploiter.git

2. Navigate to the Directory:
   cd cpexploiter

3. Install Dependencies:
   Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
   tqdm

Usage:

1. Run the Tool:
   python cpexploiter.py

2. Choose an Option:
   - Single target: Enter an IP address directly.
   - Target from a file: Provide a file with IP addresses.
   - Autoscan target: Enter a domain for subdomain enumeration and vulnerability checking.

3. Provide Inputs:
   - For autoscan, enter the domain name for subdomain enumeration.
   - Specify the folder name to save vulnerability details.

Notes:

- Ensure subfinder and httprobe are properly installed and available in your system's PATH.
- This tool assumes that you have a valid installation of curl.
